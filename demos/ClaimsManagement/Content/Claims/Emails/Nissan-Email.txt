Dear Joe,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Mary Johnson, and I am writing to formally inform you about an incident involving my vehicle, as discussed during our phone conversation today.

On the night of November 20th, 2023, at approximately 10 PM, my 1998 Nissan Maxima was stolen in Houston, Texas. When I recovered the vehicle, it had sustained visible scratches and dents on the exterior. There were no other vehicles involved in this incident. A witness was present at the scene, and I have reported the incident to the authorities. I also have a police report available for your reference.

My policy number is 456789012. Based on our conversation, it seems that this qualifies as a trivial damage claim. However, given that the vehicle was stolen, I would appreciate it if you could initiate the claims process for me.

Please let me know if you require any further information or documentation from my side. You can reach me at [Your Phone Number] or [Your Email Address]. Additionally, I am available at [Your Address] if you need to send any correspondence by mail.

Thank you very much for your assistance and understanding. I look forward to a smooth and efficient resolution
